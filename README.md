# 2D-flow-simulation-and-wake-structure-analysis-around-square-cylinder-using-SIMPLE-algorithm
Projects completed as part of the Advanced Computational Fluid Dynamics (ME634) course at IIT Kanpur.

This project involves the numerical simulation of 2D flow around a square cylinder in a channel using the complete Navier-Stokes equations. The flow is solved on a 2D domain with a uniform inflow velocity profile. The simulations are conducted using the SIMPLE (Semi-Implicit Method for Pressure Linked Equations) algorithm, and the results focus on the wake structure at different Reynolds numbers. Additionally, the impact of varying the channel width-to-height ratio on the wake structure is examined.

A Matlab script that implements the SIMPLE algorithm for solving the Navier-Stokes equations on a 2D grid is used.
Grid Setup: The simulation uses a 178x82 grid for the domain, with specified dimensions for the channel and the square cylinder.
Wake Structure Analysis: The project includes a comparison of the wake structures at Reynolds numbers 24, 40, and 162, with varying channel width-to-height ratios.

Objectives
Simulate 2D flow around a square cylinder in a channel using the Navier-Stokes equations.
Investigate the wake structure behind the cylinder at Reynolds numbers of 24, 40, and 162.
Compare the simulated wake structure with reference figures provided in the assignment.
Analyze the impact of changing the channel's width-to-height ratio (B/H) on the wake structure.
The change in the wake structure when the channel width-to-height ratio is altered (B/H = 0.25) should be noted and compared with the baseline case.
